We work on large scale distributed systems, processing almost 3 trillion events per day. We have 3.44 PB of RAM deployed across our fleet of C* servers - and this traffic is growing daily. Our customers span all industries, and they count on CrowdStrike to keep their businesses running, their communities safe and their lives moving forward. We\u2019re also a mission-driven company. We cultivate a culture that gives every CrowdStriker both the flexibility and autonomy to own their careers. We\u2019re always looking to add talented CrowdStrikers to the team who have limitless passion, a relentless focus on innovation and a fanatical commitment to our customers, our community and each other. Ready to join a mission that matters? The future of cybersecurity starts with you.\r\n\r\nAbout The Role\r\n\r\nCrowdStrike is looking for a Senior Windows Kernel Sensor Engineer to join our growing Content Research and Integration team within the EndPoint Protection Content group, which focuses on security related endpoint development on the Windows, macOS, and Linux platforms.\r\n\r\nThe Endpoint Protection Content group plays a central role in fulfilling CrowdStrike\u2019s mission to Stop Breaches.\r\n\r\nWithin the Content Research and Integration team (CRI), we develop innovative capabilities to detect suspicious or malicious behavior on customer endpoint devices. Our goal is to enable the sensor to autonomously identify and stop the bad guys where possible, and to provide useful visibility and guidance to security analysts when new previously unknown adversary activity occurs. We research attacker behavior to understand their tools and techniques, and we build the capabilities to detect and prevent their malicious activity. Our detection strategies are primarily performed directly on the endpoint, but can also execute in the cloud, and may also utilize a hybrid approach combining aspects of both environments. This ability to leverage a variety of tools across the CrowdStrike stack allow us to accomplish our detection goals while balancing local resource utilization and false positives for our customers.\r\n\r\nAs a Windows Kernel Sensor engineer within the CRI Windows team you will be focused on the research and development of sensor capabilities to provide visibility and detection support for attack techniques across supported Windows OS versions.

You\u2019ll help find creative and resourceful ways to detect Windows specific threats while also helping to develop cross platform features that leverage telemetry from common OS subsystems such as file system, memory, process, and network activity. You\u2019ll get exposure to both user-mode and kernel-mode coding practices.\r\n\r\nAs a Senior Engineer, you\u2019ll function as a key resource and subject matter expert for other engineers within the team and across the group.

We\u0027re looking for smart people who want to be challenged and take ownership of what they build.\r\n\r\nWhat You\u0027ll Do\r\n\r\nDesign and build detection logic and systems leveraged across teams within CrowdStrike to detect cyber attackers and stop breaches.\r\nExtend our existing Windows codebase and test suites utilizing C/C\u002B\u002B, Python, and other tools as appropriate.\r\nBrainstorm, define, and build collaboratively across multiple teams.\r\nBuild elegant, robust, and reliable solutions for complex technical problems.\r\nObsess about learning, and champion the newest technologies \u0026 tricks with others, raising the technical IQ of the team.\r\nDeliver and accept feedback with grace and courtesy.\r\nTroubleshoot issues within the product when necessary, assisting customer support.\r\nLeverage your understanding of engineering best practices, including topics like secure coding, testing paradigms, effective peer code reviews, logging, and resilient architecture patterns, to ensure that our code is clean.\r\nBe an energetic \u2018self-starter\u2019 who is empowered to take ownership and be accountable for deliverables, both individually and when leading a team.\r\n\r\nWhat You\u0027ll Need\r\n\r\n5\u002B years of recent experience designing, building, and delivering high-quality software in a shipping product, written in C/C\u002B\u002B for Windows\r\n2\u002B years of recent experience dealing with Windows internals, security features, and low-level system programming, APIs and design\r\nTeam player \u2013 able to lead, mentor, communicate, collaborate, and work effectively in a globally distributed team\r\nAbility to work remotely and independently with minimal supervision while still delivering on expected outcomes\r\n\r\nBonus Points\r\n\r\nRecent prior security experience, particularly in exploit and vulnerability analysis.\r\nRecent prior experience writing Windows kernel-mode drivers in a shipping product.\r\nRecent prior development or testing experience with Python.\r\n\r\nBenefits Of Working At CrowdStrike\r\n\r\nRemote-friendly and flexible work culture\r\nMarket leader in compensation and equity awards\r\nComprehensive physical and mental wellness programs\r\nCompetitive vacation and holidays for recharge\r\nPaid parental and adoption leaves\r\nProfessional development opportunities for all employees regardless of level or role\r\nEmployee Resource Groups, geographic neighbourhood groups and volunteer opportunities to build connections\r\nVibrant office culture with world class amenities\r\nGreat Place to Work Certified\u2122 across the globe \r\n\r\nCrowdStrike is proud to be an equal opportunity employer.

    "Description": "About the job\r\nMaster Licensees\r\n\r\nBackground Information \r\n\r\nBoard Advisors provide an excellent solution for ambitious businesses looking for growth,\r\n\r\nprofitability and stability.\r\n\r\nIncreasing numbers of senior level people are turning to a portfolio career, seeking to have\r\n\r\nmore control over their lives and freedom from life within a large corporate environment.\r\n\r\nExpansion \r\n\r\nOur aim is to continue increasing our market penetration throughout the world and\r\n\r\ntherefore, we seek ambitious individuals capable of growing with us as Master Licensees in different countries.\r\n\r\nOur Business \r\n\r\nWe operate within the Scale-Up marketplace servicing companies that ideally have between\r\n\r\n10 and 1000 staff and likely $2m - $100m turnover although we do mentor some smaller\r\n\r\nbusinesses.\r\n\r\nWe work directly with the business owners as part of the Board team on a long-\r\n\r\nterm, on-going basis. We also work with VCs, PEs and Funds with their portfolio companies as well as family businesses. Typically, this takes the form of working within each business between 1-10 days a month.\r\n\r\nOur approach is to provide the highest quality Board Advisor skill set, with a strong emphasis on strategic and commercial skills, and to pro-actively engage with business owners to deliver terrific value.\r\n\r\nWe are sector agnostic and provide Director-level expert skills in finance, marketing, sales, IT, HR and Managing. We also supply Non-Executive Directors, Chairs, Mentors and Coaches.\r\n\r\nWhat are the benefits?\r\n\r\nHere are some benefits of a Master License arrangement for a licensee of Boardroom Advisors:\r\n\r\nReduced Risk: One of the primary benefits of a master license arrangement for a licensee is reduced risk. The licensee can leverage Boardroom Advisors\u2019 brand reputation, established systems and processes, and marketing support to enter a new market with confidence. This can significantly reduce the risk of failure and financial loss.\r\nAccess to established systems and processes: Another benefit is access to established systems and processes. The licensee can benefit from Boardroom Advisors\u2019 proven business model, operational procedures, and best practices. This can help the licensee to avoid common mistakes and pitfalls and to operate more efficiently.\r\nAccess to Intellectual Property: The licensee can gain access to Boardroom Advisors\u2019 intellectual property, including trademarks and proprietary technologies. This can give the licensee a competitive advantage in the market and enable the development of new products and services.\r\nTraining and Support: The licensee can receive training and ongoing support from Boardroom Advisors in various areas such as product knowledge, marketing and sales, and customer service. This can help the licensee to develop their own business skills and to provide better service to their customers.\r\nBrand Recognition: The licensee can leverage Boardroom Advisors\u2019 established brand recognition to build their own brand in the market. This can help to attract new clients, Advisors and Regional Directors.\r\nExclusive Territory: The licensee can operate exclusively within a specific territory or market segment. This can reduce competition and enable the licensee to establish themselves as the leading provider in that area.\r\nReduced Investment: The licensee can benefit from reduced investment in research and development, marketing, and other areas as Boardroom Advisors may have already invested in these areas. This can help to lower costs and improve profitability.\r\n\r\nWho joins Boardroom Advisors? \r\n\r\nAll our Advisors \u201Chave been there, seen it and done it\u201D. They are predominantly well\r\n\r\nqualified, all have scaled businesses, been real life Managing Directors or CEOs in business, and all our Advisors get a real buzz out of our clients\u2019 success.\r\n\r\nTo Join Boardroom Advisors, You Will Need To\r\n\r\nI. Share our values. We believe that successful businesses not only need outstanding\r\n\r\ncommercial skills but require a strong and aligned culture in which to thrive. We are\r\n\r\nproud of our culture. Prospects, businesses owners, suppliers and our team tell us that\r\n\r\nwe are refreshingly different. Our three core values \u201Ctransparency, energy and\r\n\r\nteamwork\u201D provide the foundation on which the culture is built. We seek individuals\r\n\r\nthat are aligned with our culture and values.\r\n\r\nII. Demonstrate that you have a strong empathy towards entrepreneurs in the Scale-Up\r\n\r\nmarketplace as well as VCs, PEs and Fund portfolio companies as well as family businesses. And a strong desire to engage with entrepreneurs and investors to create a position as the \u201Ctrusted advisor of choice\u201D. We require team members who can work with businesses over the long term with a laser focus on excellent customer service.\r\n\r\nIII. Have the ability to fund yourself outside of joining our team. We are non-exclusive, no\r\n\r\ncost and no obligation. It will take time to build your Regional Director and Advisor business base, this could take months before earnings start to flow.\r\n\r\nIV. Team energy. We require individuals who can put all their energies into being part of\r\n\r\nour team. A key aspect of this is business development, and you will be expected to\r\n\r\nactively participate in helping to generate new leads for you and your team.\r\n\r\nWhat is the arrangement for Master Licensees?\r\n\r\nMaster Licensees have exclusive territorial rights to using the Boardroom Advisors brand, web site, case studies, business model, marketing systems, processes etc for a period of years. We provide initial induction, training and ongoing support starting with weekly meetings and phasing over to monthly Board Meetings over time where we provide strategic help and advice.\r\n\r\nIn exchange for helping to get the business up and running, we ask for a small initial commitment fee, a 10% royalty and a 10% shareholding in the licensee company. This ensures long-term commitment from the \u201Cparent\u201D company in the success of the licensee.\r\n\r\nHow do you deliver your services to a business? \r\n\r\nFollowing the initial meeting with a prospect business by a Regional Director,\r\n\r\nBoardroom Advisors introduces the appropriate Advisor to the business owner and ascertains the objectives and anticipated outcomes.\r\n\r\nWork is on an agreed package or number of days per month; or occasionally the delivery is an initial project with the opportunity to develop into a package or on-going days per month engagement.\r\n\r\nFor each business there is a lead Advisor and a Regional Director. This team approach helps foster a stronger B2B relationship and business loyalty.\r\n\r\nWhat type of work does Boardroom Advisors undertake? \r\n\r\nOur work covers all aspects of a Board Advisor role in a successful business. Our aim is to\r\n\r\nestablish long-term involvement with a business, generating regular income streams, rather\r\n\r\nthan work on projects. Engagements are extremely varied and dependent upon the business\r\n\r\nneeds and the stage of development the company has reached. Some examples of work the\r\n\r\nclient has as a \u201Ctrigger\u201D to dealing with us and we might undertake as part of the\r\n\r\nAppointment As Advisor Include\r\n\r\nStrategy development\r\nPerformance review\r\nSystems development\r\nFunding analysis\r\nOutsourcing and supplier analysis\r\nPricing review\r\nGrowth planning\r\nStaffing structure analysis\r\nBoard salary reviews\r\n\r\nFor more information contact Founder and CEO John Courtney and book an initial Zoom call at John@BoardroomAdvisors.co\r\n\r\nwww.BoardroomAdvisors.co",

    "Description": "About the job\r\nOverview\r\n\r\nAs a member of the military, Critical Care Nursing Officers provide care in the critical care domain of practice to ill and injured Canadian Armed Forces (CAF) members and supported populations in in-patient care and medical evacuation environments while on operation. They are specialized in intensive care, emergency room and trauma resuscitation.\r\n\r\nCritical Care Nursing Officers work within a collaborative practice model with other members of the health care team and lead the nursing care delivery within their area of practice. Critical Care Nursing Officers have the opportunity to work in different domains of nursing practice including:\r\n\r\nPatient care delivery;\r\nPolicy and program management;\r\nClinical leadership; and\r\nTraining and education\r\n\r\n\r\nWork environment\r\n\r\n\r\nCritical Care Nursing Officers usually work in civilian hospitals, Aeromedical Evacuation units, Operational CAF units, training and education establishments, and Headquarters. The work schedule may vary from shift work to a regular 40-hour work week, depending on the environment. Critical Care Nursing Officers are called to contribute to exercises, medical evacuation flights, and domestic or international emergencies.\r\n\r\nDuring field exercises and deployments to military operations abroad, Critical Care Nursing Officers live and work in the same environment as the CAF members they treat.\r\n\r\nIf you chose a career in the Regular Force, upon completion of all required training, you will be assigned to your first base. While there is some flexibility with regards to postings (relocations), accommodations can\u2019t always be made, and therefore, you can likely expect to move at some point in your career. However, if you decide to join the Primary Reserve Force, you will do so through a specific Reserve unit. Outside of training, your chosen Reserve unit will be your workplace on a part time basis, and you will not be obligated to relocate to a different base. As part of the Primary Reserve Force, you typically work one night per week and some weekends as a minimum with possibilities of full-time employment.\r\n\r\nEntry plans\r\n\r\n Direct Entry Options \r\n\r\nIn-Service Selection\r\n\r\nNursing Officers who joined the occupation through any entry plan have the opportunity, upon selection, to further specialize as a Critical Care Nursing Officer and progress in jobs, domains of practice and ranks of increasing responsibility.\r\n\r\nDirect Entry\r\n\r\nIf you already have a university degree and license to practice as a Registered Nurse in a Canadian province or territory and civilian nursing experience in a critical care environment, the CAF may place you directly into a Critical Care Nursing Officer job after evaluation of your experience. You may have to complete some education and certification to complement your civilian experience.\r\n\r\nFor further information, please contact a Canadian Forces Health Services Recruiter: HSRecruiting-RecrutementSS@forces.gc.ca .\r\n\r\nTraining\r\n\r\nAfter completing the Rank Qualification Lieutenant training, Nursing Officers selected for specialization or who have civilian experience within a critical care environment are required to complete a formal critical care nursing course and a certification to ensure they have the clinical competencies required to deliver nursing care in a critical care setting. The certification is completed in a Canadian civilian tertiary care facility through completion of a designated curriculum. The course completion and length of the certification depends on each Nursing Officer\u2019s level of previous clinical experience.\r\n\r\nCritical Care Nursing Officer may be offered the opportunity to develop specialized skills through formal courses and certification, including:\r\n\r\nCritical Care Aeromedical Evacuation Specialist;\r\nStrategic Tactical \u0026 Forward Aeromedical Evacuation;\r\nMobile Surgical Resuscitation Team;\r\nCanadian Medical Emergency Response Team;\r\nCertified Clinical Anesthesia Assistant;\r\nNurse Practitioner; and\r\nSpecial Forces support.\r\n\r\nPart time options\r\n\r\nReserve Force Critical Care Nursing Officers are trained to the same level as their Regular Force counterparts. Your civilian experience will have to reflect an employment in a critical care environment (i.e., intensive care unit, emergency room and resuscitation). If you are unsure about your civilian experience matching the job requirements, please contact a Canadian Forces Health Services Recruiter: HSRecruiting-RecrutementSS@forces.gc.ca.\r\n\r\nRelated Careers\r\n\r\nPhysician Assistant\r\n\r\nMedical Officer (CCFP(EM))\r\n\r\nMedical Officer",
