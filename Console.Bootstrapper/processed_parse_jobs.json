Since 2011, our mission hasn\u2019t changed \u2014 we\u2019re here to stop breaches, and we\u2019ve redefined modern security with the world\u2019s most advanced AI-native platform. We work on large scale distributed systems, processing almost 3 trillion events per day. We have 3.44 PB of RAM deployed across our fleet of C* servers - and this traffic is growing daily. Our customers span all industries, and they count on CrowdStrike to keep their businesses running, their communities safe and their lives moving forward. We\u2019re also a mission-driven company. We cultivate a culture that gives every CrowdStriker both the flexibility and autonomy to own their careers. We\u2019re always looking to add talented CrowdStrikers to the team who have limitless passion, a relentless focus on innovation and a fanatical commitment to our customers, our community and each other. Ready to join a mission that matters? The future of cybersecurity starts with you.",

      "Within the Content Research and Integration team (CRI), we develop innovative capabilities to detect suspicious or malicious behavior on customer endpoint devices. Our goal is to enable the sensor to autonomously identify and stop the bad guys where possible, and to provide useful visibility and guidance to security analysts when new previously unknown adversary activity occurs. We research attacker behavior to understand their tools and techniques, and we build the capabilities to detect and prevent their malicious activity. Our detection strategies are primarily performed directly on the endpoint, but can also execute in the cloud, and may also utilize a hybrid approach combining aspects of both environments. This ability to leverage a variety of tools across the CrowdStrike stack allow us to accomplish our detection goals while balancing local resource utilization and false positives for our customers.",

You\u2019ll work collaboratively to implement detection logic within the Falcon sensor which includes both user-mode and kernel-mode components that together observe system activity, recognize malicious behavior, provide on-box prevention and remediation capabilities, and send relevant security related telemetry to the Falcon Cloud. You\u2019ll help find creative and resourceful ways to detect Windows specific threats while also helping to develop cross platform features that leverage telemetry from common OS subsystems such as file system, memory, process, and network activity. You\u2019ll get exposure to both user-mode and kernel-mode coding practices.",
